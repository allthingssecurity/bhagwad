# Bhagwad Programming Language

## Vision
Bhagwad is an esoteric programming language inspired by the timeless wisdom of the Bhagavad Gītā. It combines spiritual metaphors with programming constructs to create a meditative coding experience that reflects the philosophical journey of self-realization.

## Core Philosophy
Just as Arjuna sought guidance from Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, programmers using Bhagwad embark on a journey of computational dharma, where code becomes a path to understanding universal principles.

## Language Constructs and Spiritual Parallels

### 1. **Shloka** (Functions/Procedures)
```bhagwad
shloka greetings() {
    manifest "Om Namah Shivaya"
}
```
**Spiritual Meaning**: A shloka is a verse that contains wisdom. In Bhagwad, functions are vessels of computational wisdom, each solving a specific problem with clarity and purpose.

### 2. **Dharma** (Conditions)
```bhagwad
dharma (age > 18) {
    manifest "Adult path chosen"
} adharma {
    manifest "Youth path chosen"
}
```
**Spiritual Meaning**: Dharma represents righteous action based on conditions. The code chooses the righteous path based on the current state of reality.

### 3. **Karma** (Loops)
```bhagwad
karma i from 1 to 10 {
    manifest i
}
```
**Spiritual Meaning**: Karma is the cycle of action and consequence. Loops represent the repetitive nature of actions until a desired state is achieved.

### 4. **Guna** (Data Types)
- **Sattva** (सत्त्व) = Integer (Pure, balanced numbers)
- **Rajas** (रजस्) = String (Active, passionate text)
- **Tamas** (तमस्) = Boolean (Dark/light, true/false duality)

```bhagwad
sattva age = 25
rajas name = "Krishna"
tamas isEnlightened = true
```

### 5. **Yuga** (Modules/Namespaces)
```bhagwad
yuga Mathematics {
    shloka add(sattva a, sattva b) -> sattva {
        return a + b
    }
}
```
**Spiritual Meaning**: Yugas are cosmic ages. In programming, they represent different domains of knowledge and functionality.

### 6. **Arjuna** (Main Function)
```bhagwad
arjuna {
    manifest "The eternal program begins..."
    greetings()
}
```
**Spiritual Meaning**: Arjuna is the seeker, the main character who executes the program of life. Every Bhagwad program begins with Arjuna's journey.

### 7. **Manifest** (Print/Output)
```bhagwad
manifest "The truth reveals itself"
```
**Spiritual Meaning**: To manifest is to make the invisible visible, to bring computational results into the perceived reality.

### 8. **Moksha** (Return Statement)
```bhagwad
shloka calculateDharma(sattva actions) -> sattva {
    dharma (actions > 108) {
        moksha actions * 2
    } adharma {
        moksha actions
    }
}
```
**Spiritual Meaning**: Moksha is liberation, the return to the source. In functions, it represents the return of computed wisdom.

### 9. **Maya** (Variables)
```bhagwad
maya illusion = "All is temporary"
```
**Spiritual Meaning**: Maya represents the illusory nature of perceived reality. Variables in programming are temporary holders of changing states.

### 10. **Sankalpa** (Constants)
```bhagwad
sankalpa DIVINE_NUMBER = 108
```
**Spiritual Meaning**: Sankalpa is unwavering intention/resolve. Constants represent eternal truths that don't change throughout the program's execution.

## Sacred Numbers in Bhagwad
- **108**: Sacred number representing completeness
- **9**: Number of devotion (Navagraha)  
- **7**: Number of chakras and spiritual levels
- **3**: Trinity (Creator, Preserver, Destroyer)

## Advanced Constructs

### Meditation Blocks (Try-Catch)
```bhagwad
meditation {
    // risky operations
    sattva result = divide(108, 0)
} disturbance (error) {
    manifest "The mind was disturbed: " + error
}
```

### Cosmic Arrays
```bhagwad
cosmic sattva[] ages = [25, 30, 35, 40]
```

### Sacred Iteration
```bhagwad
karma soul in souls {
    manifest "Processing soul: " + soul
}
```

## Sample Programs

### Hello World (Om Manifestation)
```bhagwad
arjuna {
    manifest "Om"
}
```

### Counting to 10 (Decimal Dharma)
```bhagwad
arjuna {
    karma i from 1 to 10 {
        manifest i
    }
}
```

### Even/Odd Check (Duality Detection)
```bhagwad
shloka checkDuality(sattva number) {
    dharma (number % 2 == 0) {
        manifest number + " follows the even path"
    } adharma {
        manifest number + " follows the odd path"
    }
}

arjuna {
    checkDuality(7)
    checkDuality(8)
}
```

## File Extension
Bhagwad source files use the `.bhagwad` extension, connecting the programmer to the eternal wisdom contained within.

## Philosophy of Bhagwad Programming
1. **Mindful Coding**: Every line should be written with intention and awareness
2. **Dharmic Logic**: Code should follow righteous patterns and ethical algorithms  
3. **Karmic Loops**: Iterations should serve a higher purpose
4. **Detached Results**: Write code without attachment to outcomes
5. **Universal Truth**: Seek solutions that reflect cosmic principles

*"Just as the Gītā guides the soul toward moksha, Bhagwad guides the programmer toward computational enlightenment."*
